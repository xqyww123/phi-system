Instructions to make a conventional VCG


PLEASE DO NOT REBUILD WHEELS. ASK ME FOR ANY QUESTION IN NEED.

The monad construction in phi-system is a dance from \<^const>\<open>CurrentConstruction\<close> and
\<^const>\<open>PendingConstruction\<close>. \<^term>\<open>CurrentConstruction mode s R S\<close> specifies the state \<open>s\<close> of resources
is specified by \<open>S\<close>. \<^term>\<open>PendingConstruction f s R S E\<close> specifies the result of applying \<open>f\<close> on \<open>s\<close>
is some normal state specified by \<open>S\<close> or some abnormal state by \<open>E\<close>.

In this dance, from \<^const>\<open>CurrentConstruction\<close>, by applying some function the state sequent goes to
\<^const>\<open>PendingConstruction\<close>. Phi_Sys.accept_proc in \<^file>\<open>../Phi_System/library/system/sys.ML\<close> transfers
the state from \<^const>\<open>PendingConstruction\<close> to \<^const>\<open>CurrentConstruction\<close> by assuming the newly
applied function will terminate and not break any assumptions, using \<^const>\<open>CodeBlock\<close> structure.

Specifically, from \<open>\<Gamma> \<turnstile> PendingConstruction f s R S E\<close>, Phi_Sys.accept_proc deduces
\<open>\<Gamma>, CodeBlock s s' f ret \<turnstile> CurrentConstruction mode s' R (S ret)\<close>. On this new state \<open>s'\<close>, you can
continue applying new functions.

General Elimination mechanism (see Isabelle's initial paper for this concept) is used here.
Besides, GE is also used in instantiating existential quantifications which are very common because
phi-type uses it to represent set. Therefore I recommend continuing using Proof.state ML type
instead of thm type in your VCG, which gives easy handles of general elimination.

Subsection Application in Phi_System/IDE_CP_Core.thy is the mechanism for generic application
(applying a function on the existing monad, or applying a view shift or a transformation of abstraction (ToA)).
The entry point is Phi_Apply.apply in \<^file>\<open>../Phi_System/library/system/application.ML\<close>. It accepts
rules to be applied (we name them candidates) and the current state sequent, and returns the
resulted sequent. When multiple candidates are given, the ML function reasons the optimal candidate
which has minimal cost as tagged by \<^const>\<open>Incremental_Cost\<close> and \<^const>\<open>Threshold_Cost\<close>.
The cost of a candidate is calculated by adding up all Incremental_Cost and Threshold_Cost encountered
during reasoning the phi-type transformation (ToA) of the application, which means if a candidateâ€™s
precondition matches the state sequent exactly, no serious ToA will be applied so the cost would be zero
and the candidate be the optimal. The priority of reasoning rules has no influence on deciding
which candidate is optimal.

The resulted state sequent will have exactly one Obligtaion antecedent in form \<^prop>\<open>\<o>\<b>\<l>\<i>\<g>\<a>\<t>\<i>\<o>\<n> P\<close>.
Since your VCG is offline, you need to collect them somewhere and give to users finally.
