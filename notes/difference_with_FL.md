Extending the conclusion of the paper, Fictional Separation Logic also implies Data Refinement. Thus the paper also discovers a perspective to interpret FSL, and suggests a canonical form to utilize maximally the implicit data refinement behind it. To compare the difference, in FSL, PCMs parameterize the logic, whereas φ-Type is an internal construction of the logic and the refinement relationship is (represented by) predicate on the logic, which is more light-weighted. If the purpose is only about reducing effort by utilizing data refinement and not relating to exclusive features of FSL about separation, φ-SL is simpler. For sure a generally ideal approach is to implement φ-SL on FSL, which is feasible and actually implemented in our case study.
