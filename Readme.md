The current version works only on Isabelle-2021 (*not* Isabelle-2021-1), but we will migrate to the latest Isabelle-2021-1 soon.

Some additional symbols are required. Please copy lines in the file `symbols` into your Isabelle symbol file `$HOME/.isabelle/Isabelle2021/etc/symbols`.
You may also need to install the Symbola font which is given in the directory `fonts`.
