- Eliminational φ-LPR, necessary in Inhabitance rule generation? Yes, the system RS uses an inefficient loop. We need item net.
- BUG: CodeBlock 𝗌'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''__
- if ‹$initialized› -> if $initialized
- Simplify inhabitance reasoning using [useful,simp]. The auto lemma φ is too redundent making auto reasoning taks a lot time
- Print/Parse sugar of variable name
- Remove Inhabited that fails to reason, in Inhabited reasoning
- type check / give type in $value
- $rB to get the value of variable rB in non-synthesis mode
- Auto detect form (?R * X) at the begining of casting or ToSA, and convert it to (X remains ?R)

- Auto mechanism for generating implication rules using constructφ
- Hide scaffolding/helper rules, to optimize sledgeharmer.

### Done

- Corecion → ● --> →
- Distance cut in Application reasoning
- Default attribute for premises
- Change the syntax of view shift
- Synthesis processes in machine integer is wrong!
