- type check / give type in $value
- $rB to get the value of variable rB in non-synthesis mode
- Auto detect form (?R * X) at the begining of casting or ToSA, and convert it to (X remains ?R)

- Eliminational φ-LPR, necessary in Inhabitance rule generation?
- Auto mechanism for generating implication rules using constructφ
- Hide scaffolding/helper rules, to optimize sledgeharmer.

### Done

- Corecion → ● --> →
- Distance cut in Application reasoning
